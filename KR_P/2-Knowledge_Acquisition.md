# Knowledge Acquisition
+ KA is the transfer of declarative statements from "source" to "sink"
+ Two different ways
  + Fully manual
  + Fully automation

## Source and Sink
+ Source
  + Domain Experts
  + know a lot about the domain
  + highly reliable about the domain
  + know how to articulate domain knowledge
  + have good metaknowledge
+ Immediate Sink
  + A document encoded in natural language or semi-NL
+ Ultimate Sink
  + A document encoded in formal KR language form

## Eliciting Knowledge
+ Proposal 1: Ask the expert to nicely write knowledge down
  + experts know to much
  + much of what they know is tacit
    + their knowledge can be discovered on demand, but cannot be sensed spontaneously
  + experts also know too little
    + their knowlegde is not full-pictured
    + representation constraints
  + expense as well

## Knowledge Base
![](img/2020-02-25-15-07-44.png)
+ TBox: 框架性的知识，描述的是一个群体的知识，往往恒定不会变化
+ ABox: 个体性的知识，描述的是个体的性质，可能随时间变化
