# Decidability and Complexity
+ Decidability
  + The problem whether $ \mathcal{T}\models C\sqsubseteq D $ is decidable iff there exists an algorithm that **terminates after finitely many steps for any $ \mathcal{EL} $ TBox $ \mathcal{T} $ and concepts $C, D$** and **outputs YES if $ \mathcal{T}\models C\sqsubseteq D $** or **outputs NO if $ \mathcal{T}\models C\sqsubseteq D $**
+ Complexity
  + The cost for an algorithm to solve the decidability problem

## Problem Complexity
### Tractable Problems
+ A problem is **tractable**, iff there exists an algorithm that **solves** the problem in **polynomial time**

### Non-tractable Problems
+ Problems that are decidable but not in polytime can be further classified according to time/space cost. 
  + NPC problems
  + Exp-time problems
  + Problems even harder than Exp-time
