## :grinning: Acknowledge
+ Most of the contents come from the materials provided by course Instructors and TAs. This repo contains a sorted version of these materials and some of my personal ideas.
+ So, plz check these websites to get raw perceptions!

## :exclamation: Attention
+ Latex grammar is not supported in GitHub markdown preview, so you are strongly recommended to
  + download this repo and use VSCode to check these files, or
  + use Chrome and install the extension [MathJax Plugin for Github](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/mathjax-plugin-for-github/ioemnmodlmafdkllaclgeombjnmnbima/related).(Still, this can only solve part of the problem...)
    + You can directly install the extension on Windows and MacOS. For Linux users, this [issue page](https://github.com/orsharir/github-mathjax/issues/24) may provide some help.
+ Almost all of the course notes deploy both Chinese and English, because
  + orginal materials are written in English, 
  + some concepts can be described more precisely in English, 
  + I am a Chinese student.
