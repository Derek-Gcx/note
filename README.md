## :exclamation: Attention
+ Latex grammar is not supported in GitHub markdown preview, so you are strongly recommended to
  + download this repo and use VSCode to check these files, or
  + use Chrome and install the extension [MathJax Plugin for Github](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/mathjax-plugin-for-github/ioemnmodlmafdkllaclgeombjnmnbima/related).(Still, this can only solve part of the problem...)
    + You can directly install the extension on Windows and MacOS. For Linux users, this [issue page](https://github.com/orsharir/github-mathjax/issues/24) may provide some help.
